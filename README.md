# UpdatePortfolio

Portfolio site using NextJs

I am updating my personal site with React and NextJs.  It is ongoing in construction.
Adding a blog page using MDX to learn a bit more about that and I'll start posting about
my journeys in the web development space.  I also plan to incorporate my long term plan of 
developing web tools to help other non-traditional learners gain access to music theory and sound design, into this site in some way.  I'll be posting 
videos about my journey and sharing audio/visual art.  Thank you for checking this out, wish me luck.
